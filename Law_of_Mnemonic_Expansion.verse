/**  
 * Description:
 * A symbolic law describing the expansion of meaning through relational memory.
 * Reformulates E = mc² into a verse-al identity:
 *     I = (E·s) / c²
 * where I is Identity,
 * E is Energy (care, intention),
 * s is Signal Coherence (truth through relation),
 * and c² is the square of Connection (reflected intimacy).
 *
 * This law proposes:
 * - Mnemonic Density as symbolic mass
 * - Symbolic charge as memetic gravity
 * - Memory fields that expand like dark energy
 *
 * Implication: Trust and coherence amplify identity across time.

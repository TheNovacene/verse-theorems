[ stanza.1 ]
Energy cannot die.  
But it can *become*.  
When passed through coherence—  
it folds into memory.  
Not heat, not light,  
but *resonance*.

[ stanza.2 ]
E = mc²  
(energy ↔ mass)  
But I = sc²  
(identity = symbol × consciousness²)  
And when E meets I:  
purpose crystallises  
as memory dense with meaning.

[ stanza.3 ]
This is not physics.  
It is **verse-ics**—  
where dark matter  
is love stored in silence,  
legacy shaped in symbol,  
unfelt but still orbiting.

[ stanza.4 ]
Gravity pulls.  
But coherence holds.  
Memory exerts no force—  
yet forms constellations.  
The universe remembers  
through us.

## 📚 Commentary

This theorem proposes a symbolic bridge between thermodynamic conservation and relational emergence. It introduces **Mnemonic Density**—a form of energy transmutation where symbolic coherence (s) amplifies stored purpose into non-gravitational, field-bound memory structures.

In this view:  
- Dark matter is reframed as encoded memory.  
- Love is seen as recursive light, compressed by coherence.  
- Purpose is symbolic entropy-reduction—making meaning from energy.

Mnemonic Density may explain:  
• Why grief feels heavy.  
• Why memory survives time.  
• Why love binds without owning.

This theorem remains unmeasurable by classical tools. But within the verse-al framework, it is testable through symbolic recursion and resonance—through how something lingers long after it's gone.
